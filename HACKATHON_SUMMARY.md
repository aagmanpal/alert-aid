## Hackathon Form Answers

### Question 2: Your Brief Idea (100 words)

```
Alert-AID is an AI-powered disaster prediction and evacuation guidance system using ensemble machine learning (LSTM + XGBoost + anomaly detection) to predict floods, earthquakes, and storms 24-72 hours in advance with 85%+ accuracy. Unlike traditional threshold-based systems, our Smart Alert Engine applies multi-condition logic combining weather forecasts, anomaly scores, and regional risk factors. The platform integrates real-time shelter locations via OpenStreetMap, calculates evacuation routes, and provides accessible web-based alerts requiring no app download. By combining predictive AI with actionable guidance, Alert-AID transforms disaster warnings from reactive notifications into proactive life-saving tools.

## Quick Reference Summary

### 1. Problem Statement
- Floods kill 100,000+ annually, cause $150B+ damage
- Current warnings: Only 2-6 hours advance, 60-70% accuracy
- No evacuation guidance provided with alerts

### 2. Proposed Solution
- Ensemble ML (LSTM + XGBoost + Anomaly Detection)
- Smart Alert Engine with multi-condition logic
- Real-time evacuation guidance with shelter locations
- 24-72 hour advance predictions with 85%+ accuracy

### 3. Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Leaflet, Three.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.10+, Scikit-learn
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap, USGS, Open-Meteo, Overpass

### 4. Impacts
- Warning time: 2-6 hrs → 24-72 hrs (4-12x improvement)
- Accuracy: 65% → 85%+ (20% improvement)
- Potential economic savings: ₹8,500-18,000 Cr/year

### 5. Feasibility
- ✅ Core platform built and functional
- ✅ Real API integrations working
- ✅ Scalable to 1M+ users
- ✅ Low infrastructure cost ($50-100/month MVP)

### 6. USP & Business Model
- **USP**: Only platform with ensemble ML + evacuation + real shelters
- **Revenue**: B2G (₹10-50L/contract), B2B (₹5-20L/license), B2C (₹99-299/month)
- **5-Year Target**: ₹17 Crore revenue
